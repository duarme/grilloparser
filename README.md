# Super-simple parser for the most voted comments on Beppegrillo.it

Since the most voted comments view ("commenti pi√π votati") has been discontinued from beppegrillo.it, this simple parser is to, somehow, bring it back.

## Usage
`$ ruby grilloparse.rb [URL]`   

* URL must be a beppegrillo.it post url.
* It requires the nokogiri gem, you can get it by `gem install nokogiri`;
* Works with ruby v. 1.9.3.

#### Example
`$ ruby grilloparse.rb http://www.beppegrillo.it/2013/10/che_cose_una_piattaforma_un_portale_no_e_il_sistema_operativo_del_m5s.html`   

Have fun!
